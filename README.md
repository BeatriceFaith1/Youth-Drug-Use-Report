# Youth-Drug-Use-Report
This project analyzed factors influencing youth smoking and drug experimentation, including counseling, parental supervision, media, peer influence, age, gender, and socioeconomic status. The insights support policymaking, mental health promotion, and strategy development in global public health interventions.
Project Background and Rationale

Youth smoking and drug experimentation remain critical public health concerns. Various factors such as socioeconomic status, access to counseling, parental supervision, and media influence contribute to these behaviors. Despite ongoing efforts, the complex interplay between these factors is not fully understood. This project aims to explore these relationships and provide actionable data to inform public health initiatives targeting youth smoking and drug use.

The goal is to highlight key patterns and correlations among demographic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors that influence youth behavior. By analyzing these factors, this project seeks to equip stakeholders with insights to improve policymaking, mental health interventions, and healthcare solutions to combat youth smoking and drug experimentation.

Methodology

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes variables such as Age Group, Gender, Smoking Prevalence, Drug Experimentation, Socioeconomic Status, Peer Influence, School Programs, Family Background, Mental Health, Access to Counseling, Parental Supervision, Substance Education, Community Support, and Media Influence.

The data cleaning process involved importing the dataset into Power BI, ensuring that data types were correct for analysis, removing duplicates, and renaming columns for clarity. Conditional columns were created to categorize data based on specific thresholds (e.g., levels of parental supervision and mental health status). After cleaning and transforming the data, it was loaded back into Power BI for further analysis.

Data Analysis and Visualization

The dataset was explored by visualizing key variables and relationships between them. The analysis aimed to uncover insights into age, gender, smoking prevalence, parental supervision, and mental health status.

Age Distribution and Smoking Prevalence: A bar chart revealed that the dataset was predominantly composed of individuals in the 18-34 age range, which is crucial for understanding youth smoking behavior. A line chart tracking smoking prevalence across age groups showed a notable increase in smoking among those aged 25-34 and 35-44, indicating that smoking behavior becomes more established with age, potentially linked to socioeconomic factors or targeted marketing.

Gender Distribution: A pie chart showed an almost equal distribution of males and females in the dataset. This balance suggests that smoking and drug experimentation behaviors may not differ significantly by gender but could vary in underlying factors such as mental health or socioeconomic influences.

Parental Supervision and Smoking Prevalence: A stacked bar chart illustrated the impact of parental supervision on smoking prevalence. Individuals with high levels of parental supervision were significantly less likely to smoke, suggesting that positive parental involvement plays a crucial role in preventing youth smoking. This highlights the importance of family influence in shaping health behaviors.

Mental Health and Smoking: A scatter plot revealed a strong correlation between severe mental health issues and smoking prevalence. Individuals with more severe mental health struggles were more likely to smoke, suggesting that smoking may serve as a coping mechanism for mental health challenges. This finding underscores the need for integrated mental health and smoking cessation programs.

Gender and Mental Health: A clustered column chart comparing male and female mental health status showed that while the overall distribution was balanced, females reported higher levels of moderate to severe mental health issues. This indicates that gender-specific mental health interventions may be necessary, as females may require tailored support for their unique challenges.

Insights

Several key insights emerged from the data analysis:

Age and Smoking: Smoking prevalence increases with age, particularly in the 25-44 age groups. This suggests that smoking behaviors become more ingrained during adulthood and may be influenced by socio-economic factors, lifestyle choices, and marketing strategies.

Parental Supervision: High levels of parental supervision are strongly associated with lower smoking rates. This reinforces the role of family influence in shaping healthy behaviors and preventing risky behaviors like smoking.

Mental Health and Smoking: There is a clear correlation between severe mental health issues and smoking. Individuals struggling with mental health challenges are more likely to smoke, highlighting the need for combined mental health support and smoking cessation programs.

Gender Differences in Mental Health: Females report higher levels of moderate to severe mental health challenges compared to males. This suggests the need for gender-specific interventions that address the mental health needs of women more effectively.

Recommendations

Based on the insights from the data analysis, the following recommendations are made:

Targeted Smoking Cessation Programs: Smoking prevalence is highest in the 25-44 age groups. Smoking cessation programs should target these demographics, addressing not just smoking behavior but also underlying social, economic, and mental health factors that contribute to smoking habits.

Promoting Positive Parental Involvement: Given the strong link between parental supervision and reduced smoking rates, public health campaigns should promote parental involvement in youth lives. Programs that educate parents on the dangers of smoking and the importance of active supervision could play a critical role in reducing smoking rates.

Integrated Mental Health and Smoking Support: The correlation between mental health challenges and smoking prevalence calls for integrated support programs. Public health initiatives should consider combining smoking cessation efforts with mental health services to provide a holistic approach to health, addressing both smoking and mental health issues simultaneously.

Gender-Specific Mental Health Interventions: The higher prevalence of severe mental health issues in females suggests the need for gender-specific interventions. Tailored mental health resources and counseling services should be developed for women to address their unique challenges and provide support in a non-judgmental and empowering manner.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this analysis highlights the complex relationships between smoking prevalence, mental health, and parental supervision among youth. The insights drawn from the data, coupled with the visualizations created in Power BI, offer valuable guidance for shaping public health policies and interventions. By targeting specific age groups, promoting positive parental involvement, integrating mental health support with smoking cessation efforts, and developing gender-specific interventions, stakeholders can address the root causes of youth smoking and drug experimentation more effectively. These data-driven strategies will lead to more informed, impactful public health initiatives that can significantly reduce smoking and drug use among youth.
